							"info|Ombré involves a gentle transition from light to dark, with the front of the brows softly shaded in light and gradually deepening toward the tail. Powder brows ensure a consistent colour from the front to the tail offering a convenient alternative for those tired of daily brow makeup application. For this procedure we use a machine to implant pigment into the skin and is suitable to all skin types regardless of age. Whether you desire a bold or subtle look, this technique is ideal for addressing thin, sparse, or mis-shapen eyebrows, especially great for mature clients. If you've previously had brow tattooing, please contact us before booking. A touch up will be required 6-8 weeks after the initial session.",
